# Titanic Dataset Analysis â€“ Machine Learning Course

This folder contains exercises focused on the Titanic dataset. The main steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: identified missing values in key columns and handled them appropriately based on their missingness type (MCAR, MAR, MNAR). Detailed comments explain the reasoning behind each approach for handling missing data.
   
2. **Cardinality Analysis**: analyzed the cardinality of categorical features, reduced the cardinality of the "cabin" feature by simplifying its labels. Comments highlight the rationale behind the reduction and how it may impact future analysis.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**: preprocessed data by splitting it into training and test sets, encoding categorical variables, and addressing missing values by replacing them with zeros. The process includes observations about the effect of these transformations on the dataset and how they might influence model performance.

Throughout the analysis, detailed comments have been added to explain the decisions made during preprocessing and to guide the reader through the steps.

These steps lay the foundation for building a predictive model on the Titanic dataset.
